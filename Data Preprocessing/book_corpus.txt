It’s in all of us. Data science is what makes us humans what we are today. No, not the
computer-driven data science this book will  introduce you to, but the ability of our
brains to see connections, draw conclusions from facts, and learn from our past expe-
riences. More so than any other species on  the planet, we depend on our brains for
survival; we went all-in on these features to earn our place in nature. That strategy has
worked out for us so far, and we’re unlik ely to change it in the near future. 
 But our brains can only take us so far when it comes to raw computing. Our biol-
ogy can’t keep up with the amounts of data we can capture now and with the extent of
our curiosity. So we turn to machines to do part of the work for us: to recognize pat-
terns, create connections, and supply us with answers to our numerous questions. 
 The quest for knowledge is in our genes. Relying on computers to do part of the
job for us is not—but it is our destiny. xivacknowledgments
A big thank you to all the people of Manning  involved in the process of making this
book for guiding us all the way through.
 Our thanks also go to Ravishankar Raja gopalan for giving the manuscript a full
technical proofread, and to Jonathan Th oms and Michael Roberts for their expert
comments. There were many other reviewers who provided invaluable feedback
throughout the process: Alvin Raj, Arthur Zubarev, Bill Martschenko, Craig Smith,
Filip Pravica, Hamideh Iraj, Heather Campbe ll, Hector Cuesta, Ian Stirk, Jeff Smith,
Joel Kotarski, Jonathan Sharley, Jörn Di nkla, Marius Butuc, Matt R. Cole, Matthew
Heck, Meredith Godar, Rob Agle, Scott Chaussee, and Steve Rogers.
First and foremost I want to thank my wife Filipa for being my inspiration and motiva-
tion to beat all difficulties and for always  standing beside me throughout my career
and the writing of this book. She has prov ided me the necessary time to pursue my
goals and ambition, and shouldered all the bu rdens of taking care of our little daugh-
ter in my absence. I dedicate this book to  her and really appreciate all the sacrifices
she has made in order to build and maintain our little family.
 I also want to thank my daughter Eva, an d my son to be born, who give me a great
sense of joy and keep me smiling. They are the be st gifts that God ever gave to my life and
also the best children a dad could hope for:  fun, loving, and always a joy to be with. 
 A special thank you goes to my parents for their support over the years. Without
the endless love and encouragement from my  family, I would not have been able to
finish this book and continue the jo urney of achieving my goals in life. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS xv
 I’d really like to thank all my coworkers in my company, especially Mo and Arno,
for all the adventures we have been throug h together. Mo and Arno have provided me
excellent support and advice. I appreciate al l of their time and effort in making this
book complete. They are great people, an d without them, this book may not have
been written.  
 Finally, a sincere thank you to my friends who support me and understand that I
do not have much time but I still count on  the love and support they have given me
throughout my career and th e development of this book. 
DAVY CIELEN
I would like to give thanks to my family an d friends who have supported me all the way
through the process of writing this book. It has not always been easy to stay at home
writing, while I could be out discovering new things. I want to give very special thanks
to my parents, my brother Jago, and my girl friend Delphine for always being there for
me, regardless of what crazy plan s I come up with and execute. 
 I would also like to thank my godmothe r, and my godfather whose current struggle
with cancer puts everything in life into perspective again.
 Thanks also go to my friends for buying me beer to distract me from my work and
to Delphine’s parents, her brother Karel, and his soon-to-be wife Tess for their hospi-
tality (and for stuffing me with good food). 
 All of them have made a great cont ribution to a wonderful life so far.
 Last but not least, I would like to thank my coauthor Mo, my ERC-homie, and my
coauthor Davy for their insightful contribu tions to this book. I share the ups and
downs of being an entrepreneur and data scientist with both of them on a daily basis.
It has been a great trip so far. Let’s hope there are many more days to come.
ARNO D. B. M EYSMAN
First and foremost, I would like to thank my fiancée Muhuba for her love, understand-
ing, caring, and patience. Finally, I owe much  to Davy and Arno for having fun and for
making an entrepreneurial dream come true. Their unfailing dedication has been avital resource for the realization of this book.

I can only show you the door. You’re the one that has to walk through it.
Morpheus, The Matrix
Welcome to the book! When reading the table of contents, you probably noticed
the diversity of the topics we’re about to cover. The goal of Introducing Data Science
is to provide you with a little bit of ever ything—enough to get you started. Data sci-
ence is a very wide field, so wide indeed that a book ten times the size of this one
wouldn’t be able to cover it all. For each  chapter, we picked a different aspect we
find interesting. Some hard decisions had to be made to keep this book from col-
lapsing your bookshelf!
 W e hope it serves as an entry point— your doorway into the exciting world of
data science.
